## 🚀 About Me

I’m an **AI/ML engineer** and **software developer** with a deep passion for building intelligent systems — from neural networks and data pipelines to full-stack web platforms and Android applications.
I also hold an **MD from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences**, and I’m especially interested in applying **AI to healthcare**, medical automation, and clinical decision support tools.
My focus is on developing **robust machine learning models**, experimenting with **deep learning architectures**, and integrating AI capabilities into real-world products.  
I enjoy bridging AI with practical engineering, creating tools that are scalable, efficient, and user-friendly.

Alongside AI research, I build production-ready backend systems using Java, and I develop mobile applications in Kotlin.
